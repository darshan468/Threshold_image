# Concise
A simple Python script using OpenCV to convert a color image to grayscale and apply binary thresholding.

# Feature-Focused Option
Image Thresholding Project: This script demonstrates fundamental image processing by reading a color image, converting it to grayscale, and applying binary thresholding (at a threshold of 150) using OpenCV to create a high-contrast black and white output.

# Technical Option
OpenCV Grayscale and Binary Thresholding: Python implementation to load an image, transform its color space from BGR to GRAY, and then use cv2.threshold with THRESH_BINARY to segment the image pixels.
